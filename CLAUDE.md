# resourceallo / upwardspiral.io — DHARMA.GIFT 🧘 (wrapping GROVE 🌳)

a wisdom school in alpha — the front door is now **dharma.gift** (a monk under the grove's trees; GROVE — grounded research on ontology, values & epistemics — lives on at `/grove`), wrapped around a living poster. no build step. serve with `python3 -m http.server` or open directly. deployed to https://www.upwardspiral.io on vercel (`cleanUrls: true`, so `/critique` serves `critique.html`; `vercel.json` also redirects the old domain `resource.gitcoin.co` here).

the layers, outermost first:

- `index.html` — the **dharma.gift landing** at `/`: a wordless hero — no kicker, no copy, no button. the sky keeps the **visitor's local time** (`data-sky` = dawn/day/dusk/night, stamped on `<html>` before first paint next to the theme; each phase swaps the hero gradient, stars, window lights, city ink `.blds`, and cityglow; meteors only at night). five era-colored trees sway on the fold — the fold IS the ground line — and a **huge monk** IS the hero (jhana-style: 🧘 at ~250px in a dark heart circle, a vast breathing halo pool, 6s breath-aura oval, heartbeat scale, four era-colored conic-gradient coherence rings, shimmer pulses — all geometry, no blur filters; click him to cycle faces, persisted in `localStorage['dg-monk']`), seated under the center tree, flanked by the city and unbothered by it. a **warm sun** (`.sun`) breathes behind his head — peaceful sunlight, always there — and his **qi drips out the bottom of the bubble** (`.qi`, animated golden beads) while a matching golden seed (hue 5) feeds the mycelium from x=.5 just below the fold. underground (`#deepen`): the live canvas mycelium (#myc/#flow), the DHARMA**.gift** wordmark (five inks + a gold `.tld`), the expansion ("dharma · what is yours to do ✦ gift · handed to you"), a small-print `.btw` line ("btw — everything here is in alpha"), and — down at the bottom of the roots — one **enter dharma.gift** button (`.gate`) that opens `/threshold`. no alpha banner, no door-roots canvas, no page section below the soil. the legacy-hash forwarder (`/#trust/...` → `/spiral#trust/...`) excludes `#deepen`. card: `og-dharma.png`; metas still point at upwardspiral.io until DNS lands.
- `threshold.html` — the **threshold** (`/threshold`): the room between the landing and the depth. a crystal cave — roots overhead (you came in through them), five crystal clusters in the era inks glowing from the floor (geometry only: glow-pool ellipses + facet lines, pulse animations) — and the offer, arriving line by line: *if you want to* / **find your purpose** (gold) / **find your peace** (blue) / **find your dharma** (magenta) / **explore new mental models** (green) / *then this site is for you.* one CTA: **continue →** `/orient`. card: `og-threshold.png`, favicon 💎.
- `orient.html` — **ORIENT** (`/orient`): the depth first, the compass reading last. opens on the **navigate the DEPTH** signpost (DEPTH in the five inks) with the census stats right under it (12,000 years · many vantage points · 1,063 mechanisms · 5 eras — moved here from spiral's footer), directly above the poster's grouped tab index ported as pure links over the faint rotating `.navswirl` spiral (same art as spiral's footer, comet included) — the whole picture (10), the fifteen questions (four kinds), the crises (24 deep links into /crises#slug), the skills (11 into /skills#slug), administrative stuff (/about, /orbit). the page closes on the rainbow `orient` h1 (gradient-clipped ramp) over four ELI5-terse stations that light on scroll (*you're not crazy* → /crises + /critique · *we've climbed out before* → /spiral + /ratchet · *here is what is yours to do* → /skills · *and here are the others* → **join the telegram** (https://t.me/+JeffHeYyATMzMDAx) + /lineage + /grove + /about). card: `og-orient.png`. `parts.html` is a redirect stub forwarding to `/orient` (keeps `og-parts.png`).
- `grove.html` — the **grove landing**, preserved at `/grove` as the school's own page (identical to the old front door; its enter button now opens `/orient`).
- `crows.html` — the **crows variant** of the landing (`/crows`, CROWS — consilience research ontology & wisdom school): same skeleton, crow/counting-rhyme symbolism instead of trees. crows still links home; the grove landing no longer links to crows (its footer was removed). if crows is ever promoted back to the front door, swap the two files' roles and relabel `#crowsback` in spiral.html.
- `spiral.html` — the poster itself, all 22 views (15 question posters + 7 whole-picture views), served at `/spiral`. this is the file that used to be `index.html`; the mirrormirror pipeline drafts it. on the coil it shows a `#crowsback` button (`← 🧘 dharma` → `/`); on posters the old `#back` button still returns to the coil. the tab index at the foot is back to its original design: "navigate **the spiral**" (✨) over the faint rotating `.navswirl` spiral with its comet — the herostats and the two-click navhint are gone (the stats moved to `/orient`). `setURL` rewrites the coil's url to `/spiral` (never bare `/`), and `spiral` is in the BASEPATH-stripping regex. the about tab's "say hi" CTA and the bio's telegram link point at the **dharma.gift telegram group** (https://t.me/+JeffHeYyATMzMDAx), not kevin's DMs.
- the ~26 redirect stubs (`trust.html`, …) now forward to `/spiral#<mode>` (not `/#<mode>`); `whole.html` and `orbit.html` deep-link into `/spiral#...` too.

## the one hard rule: every new page ships with its own twitter card

when you create a new page (a new tab/view + its `<name>.html` stub), it MUST get its own social card. the poster's card (`spiral.html`'s `<head>` meta block + `og.png`) is the single source of truth for the tag pattern and the visual style; the grove landing wears `og-grove.png`, the crows variant `og-crows.png`, both in the same family. crawlers never see `#hash` fragments — that is the whole reason each tab gets a crawlable `<name>.html` stub with its own card.

1. **image**: `og-<name>.png`, 1200×630, repo root. match the landing card's family: dark purple gradient bg, rainbow hairline bars top+bottom, mono `UPWARDSPIRAL.IO` kicker, big white all-caps title, letterspaced gradient mono subtitle, corner glyph circles, ✦ sparkles, italic tagline, footer ending `upwardspiral.io/<name>`. central art should echo the page's own visualization. build it as a 1200×630 html page and screenshot headlessly:
   `chrome-headless-shell --headless --screenshot=og-<name>.png --window-size=1200,630 --hide-scrollbars file://...`
   (playwright's binary lives under `~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/chromium_headless_shell-*/`; the card templates + render pipeline docs live in `~/Sites/mirrormirror/scripts/allocation_poster_site/build.md`)
2. **meta tags** in the stub's `<head>`, copied from `index.html`'s block, absolute urls always:
   - `og:type` · `og:url` (`https://www.upwardspiral.io/<name>`) · `og:title` · `og:description`
   - `og:image` = `https://www.upwardspiral.io/og-<name>.png` + `og:image:width` 1200 / `og:image:height` 630
   - `twitter:card` = `summary_large_image` · `twitter:title` · `twitter:description` (shorter than og) · `twitter:image` (same png)
   - `meta name="description"` + `link rel="canonical"` → `https://www.upwardspiral.io/#<name>`
3. regenerating an existing card? bust crawler caches with `?v=N` on the image url (that's why the landing page uses `og.png?v=2`).

## anatomy of a redirect stub (`<name>.html`)

~40 lines, maintained directly in THIS repo (only `spiral.html` comes from mirrormirror): GA tag, emoji favicon, `<title>`, canonical, the full og/twitter block above, then `meta http-equiv="refresh"` + `location.replace('/spiral#<name>'+(location.hash?'/'+location.hash.slice(1):''))` — the js form preserves deep links, so `/trust#gift-debts` forwards to `/spiral#trust/gift-debts`. copy an existing stub (e.g. `trust.html`) and change name/emoji/copy/image.

## sharing write-ups on hackmd

use the mirrormirror push script — the hackmd api token is hardcoded inside it (kevin's choice, private repo):

```sh
# use the mirrormirror venv — system python3 lacks `requests`
~/Sites/mirrormirror/.venv/bin/python ~/Sites/mirrormirror/scripts/push_hackmd.py <file.md>              # guest-readable link
~/Sites/mirrormirror/.venv/bin/python ~/Sites/mirrormirror/scripts/push_hackmd.py <file.md> --read owner
```

`$HACKMD_API_TOKEN` overrides the baked-in token. one new note per push; title comes from the first h1.

## deploying

`./deploy.sh` — note it historically copied a mirrormirror draft over the poster file before pushing; the poster now lives at `spiral.html`, so **do not run it blindly** — it may clobber `index.html` (now the grove landing) or miss `spiral.html` entirely. commit/push manually instead, and update the script before trusting it again.

## design system notes

- theme: dark by default, persisted in `localStorage['ra-theme']`; tokens in `:root` at the top of the style block
- display face: fraunces (google fonts), lowercase; era ramp = `#2f9e44 #a17a00 #b0561f #b535bb #1c7ed6` (bright variants for dark: `#4ecb66 #e3b31d #f07f3c #e14fe1 #42a4ff`)
- glow is built from geometry (fat soft stroke under crisp stroke), never blur filters — mobile safari's compositor dies on animated filtered layers; perf guards live in a `@media (max-width:900px),(pointer:coarse)` block at the end of the stylesheet
- gradient-clipped text (`background-clip:text`) erases emoji and paints over text-shadows and negative-z pseudo-elements — the emoji rides in `span.emj`, and legibility pools live on sibling/back layers
- adding a tour step: extend `STEPS` + the `ORDER` array in the spiral scrollytell, then shift the `data-stage` gate numbers in the css
- adding a view: `MODES` entry + tab button + wrap div + `clearX`/`renderX` choreography in `setMode` + a redirect stub html for the clean url + its `og-<name>.png` card (see the hard rule above)

## other conventions (hold these on every page)

- **self-contained**: no bundler, no external js. the only network fetch is the fraunces display font (google fonts), and it must degrade to a system serif offline; anything read at 11px stays on the system stack
- **GA tag on every page**: `G-882JMLBJG9`, top of `<head>` — stubs included
- **favicon**: inline-svg emoji data uri, one emoji per page (index ✨, critique 🪞, trust 🤝, …)
- **theme settled before first paint**: a tiny inline script reads `localStorage['ra-theme']` and stamps `data-theme` on `<html>` before any css paints — night by default, an explicit toggle choice is remembered
- **voice**: lowercase, literary prose everywhere — titles, og descriptions, even code comments read like marginalia ("the theme, settled before first paint"). og/twitter descriptions carry the cadence: concrete numbers ("60 trust machines", "12,000 years"), era-spanning pairs ("gift debts to staking and slashing"), usually ending "click around, it sparkles."
- **accessibility**: reduced-motion friendly; meaningful svgs get `role="img"` + an `aria-label` that describes what the picture argues, not just what it shows
- **hash grammar**: bare `#<slug>` = legacy alloc links; tabs are `#<mode>`; deep links are `#<mode>/<slug>`. stubs must preserve incoming hashes when redirecting
- **counts drift**: mechanism/tab counts live in readme.md, og descriptions, and the header stats — when a tab is added or grows, sweep all three
